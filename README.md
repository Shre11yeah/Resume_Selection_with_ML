# 🧠 Resume_Selection_with_ML
>
In this project, a machine learning model was built to automatically classify resumes into different job categories based on their textual content. Using NLP techniques and classification algorithms, the model analyzes resumes to determine which job role they are most suitable for.

The project includes data preprocessing, text vectorization (TF-IDF), exploratory analysis, and training ML models such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
This system demonstrates how automation can assist in HR screening and reduce manual workload in resume shortlisting.
